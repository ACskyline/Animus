#Animus
##my _graduation_ project
My professor told me to build an animation editor to simulate humen walking. Like Jeremy Clarkson always says, "How _hard_ can it be?"

This program is the first step to the animation editor. My current work is to build my own interface to load .obj and .fbx files. 
It is built on Visual Studio 2013. Glew, freeglut and glm are included under the __Dependencies__ folder. 
The intended OpenGL version is 4.5.
