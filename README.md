#Animus
##my _graduation_ project
My professer told me build a animation editor to simulate humen walking.

Like Jeremy Clarkson always says, "How _hard_ can it be?".

This program is the first step to an animation editor. My current work is to build my 
own interface to load .obj and .fbx files. The index type used in this program is GLuint.
